Description
-----------
	This simple program takes a string of characters as input and reads
through the string character by character. The goal of this program is to 
convert all the lowercase characters of the string into uppercase characters
and print them out using putchar() after conversion, if the input character
is not a lowercase, it is simply printed out as is using putchar().

How to compile
--------------
	To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing
the source files for PA2, and type 'gcc -g -o allcaps allcaps.s' (without the
quotation marks).

How to run
----------
	To run the program, simply navigate to the directory containing
the source files for PA2, and type './allcaps' (without the quotation marks).

Normal output
-------------
	Normal output is printed to stdout. An example of normal output would
be the following: 

120br@pi-cluster-033:~/pa2/pa2$ ./allcaps
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Abnormal Output
---------------
	There is no abnormal output as everything is printed to stdout.

Testing
-------
	This program was tested by manually inputing the sample test cases
provided into the program. The strings that were tested on the executable 
were the ones provided in the writeup and some of my own:
	- "Hello World!"
	- "HELLO WORLD!"
	- "hello world!"
	- "1234567890"
	- "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
	- "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
	- "NUL"
	- " "
	- "!@#$%^&*()"

Furthermore, the allcaps.s program was tested thoroughly to ensure that it 
returns a string that has succesfully converted all its lowercase characters
to all capitals and left the rest of the characters as they are. Test inputs
included lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, and symbols taken from
the ascii table.

Questions (5-7)
---------

5) Assume you have the following C code:

	long nums[] = {1, 7, 13, 18};

   What is another way to store the value at the second index of nums into a 
long x other than with long x = nums[2] (Hint: think about pointer
manipulation)?

Answer:	
	long *ptr; //declare ptr as a pointer
	ptr = nums; //set ptr to point to the 1st element in array nums
	long x = *(ptr + 1); //set long x to point to hold the 2nd element of
			     //the array.

6) In a terminal, from your pa2 directory, what single-line command (or chain
of commands) would print exactly one number that indicates the number of files
in the current directory (doesn't need to count files in subdirectories) and 
do nothing else?

Answer:	ls | wc -l


7) What would you do to ensure integrity if you find out a major logical issue
with the code while the deadline is in several hours?

I would try to fix the logical issue on my own even if I only have a few hours
left. If I am making no progress I would ask an autograder tutor for help.
If there are no tutors available, I would call up a friend to answer my 
conceptual questions but I would not ask for or accept their code as help.
So, I would avoid copying someone else's work at all costs and do my best
to finish on time while abiding with the academic integrity restrictions.
